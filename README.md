## 🪐 What is Galaxy Fight Club?

Galaxy Fight Club (GFC) is a fast-paced cross-IP PvP fighting game where players battle in real time using NFT characters and weapons. Characters from major NFT collections (e.g. BAYC, CyberKongz, Animetas) can fight together in one arena, competing for loot keys and $GCOIN tokens.

Every win in GFC earns rewards, which can be used to craft, trade, or unlock new gear across the Galaxy ecosystem.
